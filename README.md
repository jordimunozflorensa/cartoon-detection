## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that can detect and classify cartoon images. Using various image processing techniques such as HOG, LBP, and color histograms, combined with machine learning models, this project achieves accurate predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Image Processing:** Extracts features like color histograms, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and LBP (Local Binary Patterns).
- **Machine Learning:** Uses optimized models for classification.
- **Oversampling:** Balances the dataset using oversampling techniques to improve model performance.
